This is the website of Till Gartner. I'm a simple guy with simple hobbies, like

- My family and kids
- My business (I'm a manager in a really cool software company called [mgm technology partners](http://mgm-tp.com)
- Some sport: Skiing, running, swimming, more recently trying to get into wave surfing.
- Some programming (yes, even though by now I rather manage IT than code): Play around with stuff that is new to me.
