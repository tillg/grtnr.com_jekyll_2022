# grtnr.com_jekyll_2022

The content of my website. Can be reached under...

* https://tillg.github.io/grtnr.com_jekyll_2022/

## Installing & running locally

To install & run the site locally, you need to install the bundles from the `gemfile`:
````bash
bundle install
```

and then tun the site locally with `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

## Todo

* Find a more pleasant layout
* Have actions that test before publishing:
  * Can all the content be properly translated to HTML?
  * Are all the links valid?
  * Are all the images available?
* Have Google tracking
* Have sitemap
* Navigation with categories, i.e. recipes, tech, family, travel...
* Integrate search
* Integrate comments
* Differentiate posts and pages (i.e. about, impressum...)
