# grtnr.com_jekyll_2022

The content of my website. Can be reached under...

* https://tillg.github.io/grtnr.com_jekyll_2022/
* https://new.grtnr.de

## Installing & running locally

To install & run the site locally, you need to install the bundles from the `gemfile`:

```bash
bundle install
```

and then tun the site locally with `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

Once all dependies are installed, it is best to use the standard scripts that are also used by the github actions:

* **`./build.sh`** - gues what this does... ;)
* **`./post_build_check_soft.sh`**: Runs checks on the built `_site` directory. If errors are found they are reported but don't break the build.
* **`./post_build_check_hard.sh`**: Runs checks on the built `_site`directory that have to succeed, otherwise the build is considered to be broken.

## Todo & done

* ~~Fix: Images are not visible~~ 2022-08
* ~~2022-08-20 Link it to grtnr.com (with CNAME) --> Using https://new.grtnr.de instead.~~
* ~~2022-08-25 Build process should check if all links work: external, pictures, etc.~~
  * ~~Make sure we build with the same scripts locally and within the github actions~~
* ~~2022-08-27 Find a more pleasant layout~~
* Have Google tracking
* Make the recipes an extra category, also not listed in the overall blog list.
* **--- Go live ---**
* Add a build no or build date & time so that I know which version I am looking at in production
* Move all images from the old asset directory to the per-blog structure
* Make sure images are minimized during build process
* Navigation with categories, i.e. recipes, tech, family, travel...
* Lint & format Markdown before commit (commit hooks)
* Have recipes as extra collection & extra layout
* Have sitemap
* Integrate search
* Integrate comments
* Differentiate posts and pages (i.e. about, impressum...)
* Make Google analytics visible within the website - so visitors can see how many visitors there are

##  Findings, Readings, Problems

A list of topics I worked on, details I found out, problems I solved.

### Overriding theme

I wanted to override certain aspects of my theme (Hydejack): Maybe the footer, create a new layout for recipes that is based on blog layouts etc.

A very good description on [how to override certain aspects of themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) - including a way on how to do it while still using the gem based theme, which allows future updates.

```bash
# Find where the theme gem is located 
bundle info --path jekyll-theme-hydejack
/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/3.1.0/gems/jekyll-theme-hydejack-9.1.6
```

### Google Analytics

### Using Theme Hydejack

I used the theme [Hydejack](https://hydejack.com) (as of 2022-08). It looks nice, hase some images that don't get in your way, is responsive - so I give it a try. Configuration was straight forward.

But it seems to have a bug: When building the site and running my `htmlproofer` check, the check raised an error in every HTML file: ` 'a' tag is missing a reference`.

Tracking down the source I ended up in the the following file in the theme's gem: `_includes/templates/error.html`:

```liquid
<template id="_error-template">
  <div class="page">
    <h1 class="page-title">{{ strings.error.title | default:"Error" }}</h1>
    {% capture link %}<a class="this-link" href=""></a>{% endcapture %}
    {% assign text = strings.error.message | default:"Sorry, an error occurred while loading: <!--link-->." %}
    <p class="lead">
      {{ text | replace:"<!--link-->",link }}
    </p>
  </div>
</template>
```

When looking at it, it is obvious that the `href=""` will always stay empty... So I replaced it with an overridden `error.html` file in my repo. 

### Jekyll Themes

Jekyll themes I looked at:

**[Hydejack](https://hydejack.com)**: For nerds & academics (so that could fit ;) ), a bit more colorful.

**[al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio)**: **Too dry, REALLY for academics...** For academics, maybe a bit black-anbd-white-ish, but coiuld fit every content.

### Domain grtnr.com

Somehow I couldn't get the domain grtnr.com to work: When setting the DNS A Records at    this is the result of a dig (even after waiting some days):
```bash
dig grtnr.com +nostats +nocomments +nocmd

; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> grtnr.com +nostats +nocomments +nocmd
;; global options: +cmd
;grtnr.com.			IN	A
grtnr.com.		600	IN	A	15.197.142.173
grtnr.com.		600	IN	A	3.33.152.147
```

That's the way it should look:
```bash
 dig new.grtnr.de +nostats +nocomments +nocmd

; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> new.grtnr.de +nostats +nocomments +nocmd
;; global options: +cmd
;new.grtnr.de.			IN	A
new.grtnr.de.		3600	IN	CNAME	tillg.github.io.
tillg.github.io.	3600	IN	A	185.199.108.153
tillg.github.io.	3600	IN	A	185.199.109.153
tillg.github.io.	3600	IN	A	185.199.110.153
tillg.github.io.	3600	IN	A	185.199.111.153
```

For the time being I switched over to the domain https://new.grtnr.de .
### Check links

[How to Check for Broken Links in Jekyll](https://www.supertechcrew.com/jekyll-check-for-broken-links/).

This works somehow locally: 

```bash
bundle exec jekyll build
bundle exec htmlproofer ./_site
```

Problems so far:

* http links are considered a _bug_ or are reported as such. But some pages don't offer https and I still want to link them --> how to switch off this test?


### Image location

Typically Jekyll wants it's images to be in `assets/images/...`. When referring images in posts or pages, usually one references `/assets/images/image.jpg`. In my case the site might be rendered not in the root directory, so for example to `https://tillg.github.io/jekyll_test/`. Thus, referencing `/assets` points to `https://tillg.github.io/assets` rather than to `https://tillg.github.io/jekyll_test/assets`.

Other criteria that I have:

* Editing in VS Code should be smooth: When writing posts in VS Code I use the Markdown preview side by side. I would like to see the pictures in this preview, so the reference to pictures should also be valid in the source code.
* Running jekyll locally with `bundle exec jekyll serve` should also properly reference the pictures.
* In production, i.e. on `https://grtnr.com` it shopuld obviouzsly also work.

Therefore I decided keep the images close to the posts: For every post I create a subdirectory with the name of the post, i.e. `2021-12-05-till-plaetzchen/`. Inside this dir I put the markdown file with the post and the images, i.e. `2021-12-05-till-plaetzchen.md` and `plaetzchen.jpg`.

In order for Jekyll to copy the image files to the apropriate location, I have to use [jekyll-postfiles](https://nhoizey.github.io/jekyll-postfiles/).
